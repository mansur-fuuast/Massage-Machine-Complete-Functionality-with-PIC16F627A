# Massage Machine Microcontroller Programmming (MPLab) and Simulation in Proteus 
A friend of mine got stuck into troubleshooting of a massage machine. He did repaired some components but when he recovered hex code from the PIC microcontroller and tried to use it another PIC, it never worked. The code was basically protected for copying and reading by the programmer. He asked me to rescue him. This project is actually built for him and it worked like charm.
